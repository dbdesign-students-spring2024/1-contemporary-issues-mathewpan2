# Contemporary Issues In Data

In this document, I disscuss the recent disccussions regarding policies on the regulations that the government wants to make on the case of AI. We look at two articles with differing viewpoints on who should contribute to these policies.

## In Article 1: [The privacy paradox with AI](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/privacy-paradox-with-ai-2023-10-31/)

The rapid advance of artifical intellgience in the contempoary zeitgeist has enacted a lot of questions about the glaring issue of data privacy. Data privacy is an issue that has been pondered over greatly within the last decade, with many different governments making sweeping regulations in an attempt to safeguard consumers and their data.

In trying to come up with ways to regulate AI and maintain privacy, the government has conveyned mostly high-profile tech CEOS to disscuss the regulations that need to be reinforced. The article expresses no concern at the group of people chosen to make these policies. The article ends by asking current AI-scientists to respect privacy in their own frameworks.

## In Article 2: [Big Tech is Likely to Set AI Policy in the U.S. We Canâ€™t Let That Happen](https://insidebigdata.com/2024/01/27/big-tech-is-likely-to-set-ai-policy-in-the-u-s-we-cant-let-that-happen/)
The article is much less focused on the privacy concerns of AI, and how the development of this technology will affect consumers. It instead pushes that letting only Big Ceos particpate in the disscussion, and how that may have a negative effect on AI policy going forward. 

The article claims that the government officials particpating in the disscussions have very little expertise on the topic of AI, and even the CEOs in attendance do not possess the technical know-how to properly contribute to the disscussion. It argues for the inclusion of smaller companies in order to create a AI policy that will better benefit all.

The article is more focused on driving AI innovation foward at full speed instead of considering the glaring privacy issues that AI possess due to how they gather large amounts of data.
